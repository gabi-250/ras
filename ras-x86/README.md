# rax-x86-64

## `Mnemonic` and instruction map generation

An enum with all the x86-64 mnemonics is auto-generated by a build script,
which uses Gregory Comer's [x86-csv](https://github.com/GregoryComer/x86-csv).
The build script also emits `bin/map`, a serialized mapping of mnemonics to
instruction encodings.
